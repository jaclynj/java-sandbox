A place for me to play around with [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/), [Bazel](https://bazel.build/), and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org). It's not much yet...

## Setting up

You will need to have Bazel version higher than 0.23.0 

Set `BAZEL_TARGET_PATH` to your Bazel install path for your bazel (or bazel-real) file in order to to build and run locally.

If you have an older version of Bazel installed that you want to keep, install the newer version in a different directory and set the `BAZEL_TARGET_PATH` to that path. 

## Getting Started
Use `make help` to see what you can do.
